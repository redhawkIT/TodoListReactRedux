## Three Principles

Redux can be described in three fundamental principles:

#### Single
source of truth

**The**** ****[state](http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html#state)**** ****of
your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single**** ****[store](http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html#store).**

#### State is read-only

**The only way to change the state is to emit an**** ****[action](http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html#action),
an object describing what happened.**

#### Changes are made with pure functions
